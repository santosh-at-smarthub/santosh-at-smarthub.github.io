SmartHub will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, either replace that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software reported to SmartHub by You in writing during the Warranty Period. If SmartHub determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software, SmartHub will refund to You the amount paid by You for that Software, in which case the License for that Software will terminate.</p>

    <p><strong>7.2</strong> <strong>Software Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>. Other than the warranty above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, smarthub and its suppliers make no other express warranties under this eula, and disclaim all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and any warranty arising by statute, operation of law, course of dealing or performance, or usage of trade.

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="intellectual-property-indemnification">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.</h4>

    <p><strong>8.1</strong> <strong>Defense and Indemnification</strong>. Subject to the remainder of this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification), SmartHub shall defend You against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright of such third party, or misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of Your actions) under the laws of: (a) the United States and Canada; (b) the European Economic Area; (c) Australia; (d) New Zealand; (e) Japan; or (f) the People’s Republic of China, to the extent that such countries are part of the Territory for the License (“Infringement Claim”) and indemnify You from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You: (i) promptly notify SmartHub in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow SmartHub sole control over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to SmartHub requests for assistance. You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of SmartHub.</p>

    <p><strong>8.2</strong> <strong>Remedies</strong>. If the alleged infringing Software become, or in SmartHub’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, SmartHub will, at SmartHub’s option and expense, do one of the following: (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make continued use of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon Your certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to related support services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped. Nothing in this Section 8.2 (Remedies) shall limit SmartHub’s obligation under Section 8.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify You, provided that You replace the allegedly infringing Software upon SmartHub’s making alternate Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the allegedly infringing Software upon receiving SmartHub’s notice terminating the affected License.</p>

    <p><strong>8.3</strong> <strong>Exclusions</strong>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SmartHub will have no obligation under this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or otherwise with respect to any claim based on: (a) a combination of Software with non-SmartHub products (other than non-SmartHub products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the Software when use of a newer SmartHub version would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made without SmartHub’s express written approval; (e) any claim that relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by SmartHub into Software listed on SmartHub’s commercial price list; or (f) any Software provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis. THIS SECTION 8 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION) STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND SmartHub’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="limitation-of-liability">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h4>

    <p><strong>9.1</strong> <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> To the maximum extent mandated by law, in no event will smarthub and its licensors be liable for any lost profits or business opportunities, loss of use, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, business interruption, loss of data, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages under any theory of liability, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, product liability, or otherwise. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the preceding limitation may not apply to you. Smarthub’s and its licensors’ liability under this eula will not, in any event, regardless of whether the claim is based in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, exceed the greater of the license fees you paid for the software giving rise to the claim or $5000. The foregoing limitations shall apply regardless of whether smarthub or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages and regardless of whether any remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>9.2</strong> <strong>Further Limitations</strong>. SmartHub’s licensors shall have no liability of any kind under this EULA and SmartHub’s liability with respect to any third party software embedded in the Software shall be subject to Section 9.1 (Limitation of Liability). You may not bring a claim under this EULA more than eighteen (18) months after the cause of action arises.</p>
